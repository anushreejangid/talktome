Software Engineering is the study and application of engineering to the design, development, and maintenance of software.

Typical formal definitions of software engineering are:

"the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software".
"an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production".
"the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines".
The term has been used less formally.
as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis.
as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming, as opposed to the theory of computer programming, which is called computer science.
as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices.
